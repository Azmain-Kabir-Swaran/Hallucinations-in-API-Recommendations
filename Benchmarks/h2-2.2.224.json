Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code or projects. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the project's source code.\n2. Analyze the code to identify classes and their properties.\n3. Filter out abstract classes.\n4. List the names of the non-abstract classes.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned the project is h2-2.2.224, I'm unable to provide the specific class names. You would need to access the source code of the project to get the correct answer.",
