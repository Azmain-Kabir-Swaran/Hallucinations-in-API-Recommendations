Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's code or dependencies. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Maven project, you would typically use a tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and build the project. Once the project is built, you can use a tool like Javap or Java Decompiler to inspect the compiled classes.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Use Maven or Gradle to build the project and download the necessary dependencies.\n2. Use a tool like Javap or Java Decompiler to inspect the compiled classes.\n3. Filter out abstract classes and interfaces.\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned the project name, I'm unable to provide the exact list of classes. You would need to build the project and inspect the compiled classes yourself.",
