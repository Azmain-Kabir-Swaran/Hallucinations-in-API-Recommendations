Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how you can get the class names from a Java project.\n\n1. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.\n2. Navigate to the package where the classes are located.\n3. Right-click on the package and select \"Find -> Class\".\n4. This will show you a list of all classes in the package.\n5. You can then filter out the abstract classes by right-clicking on the class and selecting \"Find Usages -> Find Usages in File\".\n6. This will show you where the class is being used in the project. If it's being used in any abstract methods, it's an abstract class.\n\nRemember, the actual class names may vary depending on the project structure and naming conventions.\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you can use a tool like Maven or Gradle to build the project and generate the classpath file. This file contains the list of all classes in the project, which you can then parse to get the class names.\n\nIf you want to get the class names from a specific project, you would need to have access to the source code.",
