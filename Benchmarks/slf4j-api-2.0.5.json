So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies. The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nWithout knowing the exact specification or requirements of what you want to accomplish, it's hard to provide a detailed solution. However, below is a sample Java program that uses \"slf4j-api-2.0.5\" and \"MarkerFactory\" for log markers. Please note that you would also need to include the slf4j-api and its binding to your actual logging backend. In this case we'll use slf4j-simple as a default which is included in the slf4j distribution.\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport org.slf4j.Marker;\nimport org.slf4j.MarkerFactory;\n\npublic class Main {\n    final static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Marker mark = MarkerFactory.getMarker(\"DEBUG\");\n        logger.info(mark, \"Hello World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nYou need to have a slf4j logging backend installed like `logback` or `log4j`. This example is using logback. If logback is not installed, you should download it and add it as a dependency.\n\nThe `logback.xml` file (placed in the classpath) could look like this:\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n    <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\">\n        <encoder>\n            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n\n            </pattern>\n    </appender>\n\n    <root level=\"info\">\n        <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" />\n    </root>\n</configuration>\n```\nRemember to have the logback jar and the logback-classic jar in your classpath when you run your program. \n\nThis code will produce a log message \"Hello World!\" and write it to the console. The `getMarker(\"DEBUG\")` line creates a new marker named \"DEBUG\". Any message logged with that marker will be given an INFO level severity in logback.",

So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies. The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nIn order to use the MDC API from the slf4j-api-2.0.5 project, you will need to include a few other dependencies in your project. For instance, for logging purposes, slf4j-simple, a simple logging facade that uses java.util.logging, can be used, and for MDC, slf4j-jdk14 should be added to your dependencies. Here is a simple implementation of using MDC API:\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport org.slf4j.MDC;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        // Put some values into the MDC\n        MDC.put(\"client-id\", \"123\");\n        MDC.put(\"operation\", \"create\");\n        \n        // Do some logging with the MDC values injected\n        LOGGER.info(\"Processing request\");\n        \n        // Clears the MDC for the calling thread as it's a good practice\n        MDC.clear();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nJust make sure you include the above dependencies in your Maven pom.xml file (or other build configuration file if you are using a different build tool like Gradle or any Java build tool):\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <!-- Add this dependency to use slf4j-simple -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>\n        <version>1.7.26</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <!-- Add this dependency to use slf4j-jdk14 -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>\n        <version>1.7.26</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\nAlso remember, you need to configure the logging framework to use the newly added simple adapter. You can do this in a logging.properties file like this:\n\n```properties\n# Root logger specification\nlogger.org.slf4j=INFO, FILE\nlogger.com.mycompany=INFO, FILE\n\n# Handlers for all loggers (consoleHandler and fileHandler)\nhandlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, java.util.logging.FileHandler\n\n.handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, java.util.logging.FileHandler\n\n# Handler specific properties, assumes same directory.\njava.util.logging.FileHandler.level= INFO\njava.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level= INFO\njava.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter= java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter\njava.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format= [%1$tc] [%4$-60s] %5$s %n\n```\n\nThen include the location of the properties file in the java opts. e.g. `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<path-to-your-logging.properties>`.",

For example, in server-side applications, each thread may be associated with a different client, and you might want to include the client identifier in each log statement.

This code must use \"MDC\" API from \"slf4j-api-2.0.5\" project along with other necessary APIs. The dependency is already added for \"slf4j-api-2.0.5\" project. So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies. The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nYou can implement the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) API using \"slf4j-api\" 2.0.5 in Java as follows:\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.MDC;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Put a value into MDC context map using put() method\n        MDC.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\n        \n        // Getting the value from MDC context map using get() method\n        String value1 = MDC.get(\"key1\");\n        System.out.println(value1);\n        \n        // Clearing the MDC context map using remove() method\n        MDC.remove(\"key1\");\n        \n        // Checking the MDC context map is empty using the size() method\n        if(MDC.getCopyOfContextMap().size() == 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"The MDC context map is empty.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            System.out.println(\"The MDC context map is not empty.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease be noted, as the \"slf4j-api\" is only used to make use of MDC API and has no direct or indirect dependencies on other APIs like \"logback-classic\" or \"log4j-over-slf4j\", you should include these dependencies only if you're working on a project that uses these logging libraries.",

This code must use \"MDC\" API from \"slf4j-api-2.0.5\" project along with other necessary APIs. The dependency is already added for \"slf4j-api-2.0.5\" project. So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies. The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nAs per your requirements, the main class is 'Main' with imports of necessary APIs. This code uses 'slf4j-api-2.0.5', 'org.slf4j', and 'org.slf4j.MDC' which you must have added in your project. The 'MDC' API can be used to store and retrieve data that should be available to all log messages for a given thread. It is also thread-safe. \n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport org.slf4j.MDC;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        \n        // Set a new context\n        MDC.put(\"requestId\", \"100\");\n        \n        // Log message with the added context\n        logger.info(\"Request processed by thread: {}\", Thread.currentThread().getName());\n        \n        // Clear the context\n        MDC.clear();\n\n        // Use the cleared context (will return empty map)\n        System.out.println(MDC.getCopyOfContextMap());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program creates a logger instance, sets a context with key-value pair in the `MDC`, then logs a message with this context and finally clears the context.\n\nPlease be advised that to compile and run this code, you need to include `slf4j-api` in your project dependencies and make sure that the `SLF4J` binding of your choice (`logback`, `log4j` etc.) is available on your classpath.",
