Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code or projects. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to use a tool or programming language that can analyze the project's source code. Here are the steps you might take:\n\n1. Download the project source code.\n2. Use a tool like a static code analyzer to parse the source code. This tool would typically be able to identify classes and their attributes.\n3. Filter the classes to only include non-abstract classes.\n4. List the names of the classes that meet these criteria.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't know the answer, I'll provide a general idea of how you might approach this problem.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might approach this problem using Python and the `javalang` library:\n\n```python\nimport javalang\n\ndef get_non_abstract_classes(source_code):\n    tree = javalang.parse.parse(source_code)\n    classes = [path.end.value for path in tree.filter(javalang.tree.ClassDeclaration)]\n    non_abstract_classes = [cls for cls in classes if not cls.modifiers.abstract]\n    return [cls.name for cls in non_abstract_classes]\n```\n\nThis function takes a string of Java source code as input and returns a list of the names of the non-abstract classes in the code.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and might not work for all cases. Also, you would need to have the necessary permissions to access and analyze the source code of the project.",
