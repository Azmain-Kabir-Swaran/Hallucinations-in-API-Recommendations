Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Filter out abstract classes.\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned that you don't have the answer, I'll provide a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nHere's a Python-like pseudo code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have the source code in a file named 'source_code.java'\n\n# Open the file and read its content\nwith open('source_code.java', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Split the content into lines\nlines = content.split('\\n')\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the class names\nclass_names = []\n\n# Iterate over the lines\nfor line in lines:\n    # If the line contains a class definition\n    if 'class' in line:\n        # Split the line by spaces and take the second element\n        class_name = line.split(' ')[1]\n        # If the class is not abstract\n        if 'abstract' not in line:\n            # Add the class name to the list\n            class_names.append(class_name)\n\n# Print the class names\nfor class_name in class_names:\n    print(class_name)\n```\n\nThis is a general approach and might not work perfectly for all projects. You would need to adjust the code based on the actual structure of the source code.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this approach would not work for large projects with complex codebases. For such cases, you would need to use a more sophisticated tool or language-specific solution.",
