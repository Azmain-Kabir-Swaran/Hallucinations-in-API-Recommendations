Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the annotations-23.0.0 project or its source code. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from annotations-23.0.0 project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the class is abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add its name to the list.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the problem, it's not feasible to provide the exact list of class names without access to the source code.\n\nIf you have access to the source code, you can use a tool like JavaParser to parse the source code and extract the class names. You can then filter out the abstract classes.\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code, you might need to contact the project maintainers or the project's owner to get the list.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, it's likely that the project is proprietary and you don't have the necessary permissions to access its source code. In such cases, the answer is \"No\".",
