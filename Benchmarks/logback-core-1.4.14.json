Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the classes are abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't have the source code, I can't provide you with a specific list of classes. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the classes are abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that can be used to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\n\ndef get_non_abstract_classes(directory):\n    non_abstract_classes = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            if file.endswith(\".java\"):\n                with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as f:\n                    content = f.read()\n                    classes = re.findall(r'public class (\\w+)', content)\n                    for class_name in classes:\n                        if not re.search(r'abstract class', content):\n                            non_abstract_classes.append(class_name)\n    return non_abstract_classes\n\ndirectory = \"/path/to/your/project\"\nnon_abstract_classes = get_non_abstract_classes(directory)\nprint(non_abstract",
