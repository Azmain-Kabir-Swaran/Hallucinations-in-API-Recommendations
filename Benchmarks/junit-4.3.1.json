Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the JUnit project or its source code. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list all non-abstract classes in a Java project, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Clone or download the JUnit 4.3.1 project.\n2. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.\n3. Use the \"Find Action\" feature to search for all non-abstract classes.\n4. Filter the results to only include classes that are not abstract.\n5. Copy the class names and paste them into a list.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the actual steps may vary depending on the specific IDE and project structure.\n\nAs for the number of classes, it's impossible to provide an exact number without knowing the specific project. The number of classes in a project can vary greatly depending on the project's complexity and size.\n\nIf you want to know the exact number of non-abstract classes in JUnit 4.3.1, you would need to perform these steps and count the number of classes listed.",
