Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to find the non-abstract classes in a Java project.\n\nHere are the steps to find the non-abstract classes in a Java project:\n\n1. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.\n2. Navigate to the package where the classes are located.\n3. Right-click on the package and select \"Find\" or \"Search\".\n4. In the search dialog, select \"Java\" from the dropdown.\n5. In the search text box, type \"abstract\" and press \"Find\".\n6. The IDE will show you all the abstract classes in the package.\n7. To find non-abstract classes, you can type \"class\" instead of \"abstract\".\n\nRemember, the classes you find may not be the ones you need. You may need to filter out the classes based on their functionality or purpose.\n\nIf you have the source code, you can use a tool like \"JD-GUI\" to decompile the .class files and then use a text editor to search for the classes.\n\nIf you don't have the source code or the project is too large to decompile, you may need to use a static analysis tool or manual code review to find the non-abstract classes.\n\nPlease note that the accuracy of the answer depends on the specific project and the classes you are looking for.",
