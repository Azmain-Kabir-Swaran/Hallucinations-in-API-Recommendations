Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code from a project. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically use a tool like a code analysis tool or a static code analysis library. These tools can analyze the code and provide information about the structure and usage of the code.\n\nHere are the steps you could take:\n\n1. Download the project: You would need to download the project from the source control system (like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) and extract it to your local machine.\n\n2. Analyze the code: You would use a tool like a static code analysis library like SonarQube or PMD. These tools can analyze the code and provide information about the structure and usage of the code.\n\n3. Filter the results: You would then need to filter the results to only include classes that are non-abstract and are part of the API.\n\n4. List the classes: Finally, you would list the names of the classes that meet the criteria.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and the specific steps may vary depending on the programming language and the specific project. Also, the actual number of classes may be less than 50, as some classes may be part of the API but are not explicitly exposed.\n\nIf you need a specific solution, you would need to provide more details about the project and the API you are trying to access.",
