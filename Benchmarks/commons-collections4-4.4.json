Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project or any other external resources. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the classes are abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, as I don't have direct access to the source code of a project, I can't provide you with the exact list of classes. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the classes are abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHere's a Python example of how you might approach this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\n\ndef get_classes(source_code):\n    classes = re.findall(r'public class\\s+(\\w+)', source_code)\n    return classes\n\ndef is_abstract(class_name, source_code):\n    return re.search(r'public abstract class\\s+%s' % class_name, source_code) is not None\n\ndef get_non_abstract_classes(source_code):\n    classes = get_classes(source_code)\n    non_abstract_classes = [class_name for class_name in classes if not is_abstract(class_name, source_code)]\n    return non_abstract_classes\n\ndef main():\n    source_code = open('commons-collections4-4.4.java', 'r').read()\n    non_abstract_classes = get_non_abstract_classes(source_code)\n    print(non_abstract_classes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script reads the source code of a Java file, identifies all classes, checks if they are abstract, and if not, adds them to a list.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and might not work for all projects or all languages. Also, the accuracy of the results will depend on the structure and naming conventions of the project.",
