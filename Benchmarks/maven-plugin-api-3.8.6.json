Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's code or dependencies. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Maven project, you would typically use a tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and build the project. Once the project is built, you can use a tool like Javap or a Java decompiler to inspect the bytecode of the classes.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Use Maven or Gradle to build the project and download the necessary dependencies.\n2. Use a tool like Javap or a Java decompiler to inspect the bytecode of the classes.\n3. Filter out abstract classes and interfaces.\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nHere's a simple example using Javap:\n\n```bash\njavap -public -c com.example.MyClass\n```\n\nThis will list the public methods and constructors of the class `com.example.MyClass`.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the specifics may vary depending on the project and the dependencies used. Also, the list of classes may not be complete or accurate due to the complexity of the project and dependencies.\n\nIf you need a more specific answer, please provide more details about the project and the specific classes you're looking for.",
