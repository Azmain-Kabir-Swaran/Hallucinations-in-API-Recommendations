The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nI understand the request as you needing to integrate Commons Lang library to the program. The \"classpath\" for the Apache Commons Lang project is correctly added but the code does not contain the ClassUtils API method which is required. The ClassUtils API method does not seem to exist for the Apache Commons Lang version 2.6. \n\nHowever, to showcase a simple program using Apache Commons Lang library, you could write the following code:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String str = \" Hello World \";\n        System.out.println(StringUtils.trimToNull(str));  \n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we are importing the `StringUtils` class from the Apache Commons Lang library which provides functionality for manipulating strings. The `trimToNull` method from StringUtils returns `null` if the string is all whitespace or is null, otherwise it trims the string. In the main method, we have a string `str` with leading and trailing whitespaces and print the result of the `trimToNull` method.\n\nThe above is a simple example but you can use the ClassUtils from commons-lang-2.6 project similarly in the same way. The main task here is to add necessary imports and use classes/methods correctly from the respective libraries/frameworks.\n\nPlease adapt the above example according to your needs.",
