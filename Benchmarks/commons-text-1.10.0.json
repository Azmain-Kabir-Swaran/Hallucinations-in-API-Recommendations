Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of commons-text-1.10.0 project. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the classes are abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, as I don't have direct access to the source code of commons-text-1.10.0 project, I can't provide you with the exact list of classes.\n\nIf you have access to the source code, you can use a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to navigate through the source code and find the classes. You can also use a tool like JD-GUI to decompile the jar file and inspect the classes.\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code, you can use a tool like JD-GUI to decompile the jar file and inspect the classes. You can then manually search for non-abstract classes.\n\nPlease note that the process can vary depending on the language and structure of the project.",
