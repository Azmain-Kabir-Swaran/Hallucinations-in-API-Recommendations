Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's source code or dependencies. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to use a tool or library that can analyze the Java bytecode or source code of the project. This could be done using a static code analysis tool like SonarQube, or a dynamic analysis tool like Java agents or Java Instrumentation API.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Download the project's source code or jar file.\n2. Use a tool or library to analyze the code. For example, you could use a static code analysis tool like SonarQube or a dynamic analysis tool like Java agents or Java Instrumentation API.\n3. Filter the results to only include non-abstract classes.\n4. List the class names.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and the specific steps may vary depending on the project and the tool or library you choose to use. Also, the accuracy of the results may depend on the complexity of the project and the tool or library's capabilities.\n\nAs for the specific classes, it's impossible to provide a list without knowing the project's context and requirements.",
