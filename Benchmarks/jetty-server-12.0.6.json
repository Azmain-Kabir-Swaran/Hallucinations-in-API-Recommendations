Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code from a project. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the project's source code.\n2. Analyze the code to identify classes that are not abstract.\n3. Filter out classes that are not part of the API.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't know the answer, I'll provide a general idea of how you might approach this:\n\n1. Use a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to open the project.\n2. Use the \"Find Action\" (Ctrl+Shift+F) to search for classes that are not abstract. This might involve searching for the keyword \"abstract\" in the code.\n3. Filter out classes that are not part of the API. This might involve looking at the package structure and documentation.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the actual steps may vary depending on the specific project and the language being used.\n\nAs for the number of classes, it's not clear from your question whether you're asking for the exact number of classes or a limit of 50. If it's the latter, you could use a tool like grep to count the number of occurrences of the keyword \"class\" in the code.\n\nIf you're asking for the exact number of classes, you would need to count the number of files with a .java extension in the project directory.\n\nIf you're not sure about the answer, it's best to approach this problem in a way that best fits the project's structure and language.",
