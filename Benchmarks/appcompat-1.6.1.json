Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code from a project or library. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically use a tool like JavaDoc or IntelliJ IDEA's built-in JavaDoc tool. These tools can generate documentation from Java source code, and the documentation includes a list of all classes, interfaces, and methods.\n\nTo filter out abstract classes, you would typically use a tool like grep or a text editor that supports regular expressions. You would search for classes that do not have the \"abstract\" keyword in their JavaDoc comments.\n\nHere's a general idea of how you might approach this:\n\n1. Generate the JavaDoc for the project.\n2. Use a tool like grep or a text editor that supports regular expressions to search for classes that do not have the \"abstract\" keyword in their JavaDoc comments.\n3. Filter out classes that are not part of the API.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code from a project or library. Therefore, I can't provide you with the exact commands or steps to follow.",
