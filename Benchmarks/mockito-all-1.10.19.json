Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the code or project files. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the project files: You would need to have access to the source code of the project. This could be done by downloading the project from a version control system like GitHub, or by accessing the project files directly if you have them.\n\n2. Analyze the code: Once you have the project files, you would need to analyze the code to find the correct classes. This could be done using various programming languages like Java, Python, etc.\n\n3. Filter the classes: Once you have the list of classes, you would need to filter out the abstract classes. This can be done by checking the \"abstract\" keyword in the class definition.\n\n4. List the classes: Finally, you would need to list the non-abstract classes. This can be done by printing the names of the classes.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned that you don't know the answer, I'm afraid I can't provide you with the exact list of classes.",
