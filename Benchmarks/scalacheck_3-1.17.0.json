Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view code or projects. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how you can find the correct API class names from a ScalaCheck project.\n\nScalaCheck is a testing toolkit for Scala. It is used to generate random data for testing purposes.\n\nHere are the steps to find the correct API class names:\n\n1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).\n\n2. Navigate to the ScalaCheck library. You can usually find it in your project structure under the `lib` folder.\n\n3. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Prop`. These are the properties that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\n4. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Gen`. These are the generators that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\n5. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary`. These are the arbitraries that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\n6. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Prop.Aux`. These are the properties that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\n7. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Gen.Aux`. These are the generators that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\n8. Look for the classes that extend `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary.Aux`. These are the arbitraries that ScalaCheck uses to generate random data.\n\nRemember, these are general steps and the actual class names can vary depending on the specific ScalaCheck project you are working with.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific project, you would need to have access to that project to view the code.",
