Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Filter out abstract classes.\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned that you don't have the answer, I'll provide a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nHere's a Python-like pseudo code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have the source code in a file named 'source_code.java'\n\n# Open the file and read its content\nwith open('source_code.java', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Split the content by 'class' keyword to get individual class definitions\nclass_definitions = content.split('class')\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store non-abstract classes\nnon_abstract_classes = []\n\n# Iterate over each class definition\nfor class_definition in class_definitions:\n    # Check if the class is abstract\n    if 'abstract' in class_definition:\n        # If it is, skip it\n        continue\n    else:\n        # If it's not, extract the class name and add it to the list\n        class_name = class_definition.split('{')[0].strip()\n        non_abstract_classes.append(class_name)\n\n# Print the list of non-abstract classes\nfor class_name in non_abstract_classes:\n    print(class_name)\n```\n\nThis is a general approach and might not work perfectly for all projects. You would need to adjust the code based on the actual structure of the source code. Also, it's important to note that this approach assumes that the source code is in Java and follows standard Java syntax.\n\nIf you have the source code, you can use a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to navigate through the code and find the classes. You can also use a tool like JDT (Java Development Tools) to parse the Java source code and extract the class names.",
