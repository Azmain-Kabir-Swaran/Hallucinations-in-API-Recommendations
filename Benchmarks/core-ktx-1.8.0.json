Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project or any external resources. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the code to identify classes that are not abstract.\n3. Filter out classes that are abstract.\n4. List the names of the remaining classes.\n\nHowever, as I don't have direct access to the source code of the core-ktx-1.8.0 project, I can't provide the specific class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n   - You can clone the project from its GitHub repository.\n   - Alternatively, you can download the source code as a zip file and extract it.\n\n2. Analyze the code to identify classes that are not abstract.\n   - You can use a tool like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to open the source code and navigate through the classes.\n   - You can use a static code analysis tool like SonarQube or PMD to identify classes that are not abstract.\n\n3. Filter out classes that are abstract.\n   - You can use a programming language like Java or Kotlin to write a script that filters out classes that are abstract.\n\n4. List the names of the remaining classes.\n   - You can use a programming language like Java or Kotlin to write a script that lists the names of the remaining classes.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the specific steps may vary depending on the programming language and the structure of the project.",
