Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how you can find the class names from a Spring project.\n\nSpring projects are typically built using Maven or Gradle, which are build automation tools. The class names can be found in the compiled .class files.\n\nHere are the steps to find the class names:\n\n1. Download the Spring project source code.\n2. Unzip the source code.\n3. Navigate to the target directory where the compiled .class files are located.\n4. Use a command line tool like \"jar\" or \"unzip\" to extract the class files.\n5. Use a Java decompiler like \"cfr\" or \"procyon\" to decompile the class files into readable Java code.\n6. Look for non-abstract classes in the decompiled code.\n\nRemember, the actual class names may vary based on the project structure and the code conventions.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific project, you can ask for the project's source code and I can provide the class names accordingly.",
