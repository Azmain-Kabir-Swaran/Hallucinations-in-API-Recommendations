Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the class is abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the problem, I can't provide you with the exact list of classes. You would need to do this manually or use a tool that can parse Java source code.\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you could use a tool like JavaParser, which can parse Java source code and extract class information. However, this would require a good understanding of the Java language and the structure of the source code.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific list of classes, you would need to provide more information about the project and the specific classes you're looking for.",
