Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's code or dependencies. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Maven project, you would typically need to use a tool that can analyze the project's dependencies and classes. Maven is a popular choice for managing Java projects, and it uses the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the code.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Download the Maven project: You can download the project from a version control system like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.\n\n2. Analyze the project: You can use a tool like Maven or Gradle to analyze the project. Maven is a popular choice for Java projects, and it uses the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the code.\n\n3. Identify the correct API's: Once you have the project analyzed, you can identify the correct API's by looking for non-abstract classes. You can use a tool like the Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA to navigate through the project's code.\n\n4. List the class names: Once you have identified the correct API's, you can list their class names. You can use a tool like Maven or Gradle to list the class names.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the specific steps may vary depending on the project and the tools you are using. Also, the number of classes listed may vary depending on the project and the tools you are using.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific answer, please provide more details about the project and the tools you are using.",
