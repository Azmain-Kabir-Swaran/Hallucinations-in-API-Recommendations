Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of the aspectjweaver-1.9.21 project. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the class is abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the problem, it's not feasible to provide the exact list of classes in this format.\n\nIf you have access to the source code, you can use a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to navigate through the project and find the classes. You can also use a tool like JD-GUI to decompile the jar file and inspect the classes.\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code, you can use a tool like JD-GUI to inspect the jar file and find the classes. You can then manually inspect each class to determine if it's abstract or not.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, it's because the problem statement doesn't provide enough information to determine the correct answer. You would need to know the specific classes and their properties to determine if they are abstract or not.",
