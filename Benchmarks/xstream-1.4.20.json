Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of xstream-1.4.20 project. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo find the correct API class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Clone the project or download the source code.\n2. Use a tool like Maven or Gradle to build the project and generate the class files.\n3. Use a tool like Javap or a Java decompiler like Procyon to analyze the bytecode and extract the class names.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't know the answer, I'll provide a general approach:\n\n1. Clone or download the xstream-1.4.20 project.\n2. Use a tool like Maven or Gradle to build the project and generate the class files.\n3. Use a tool like Javap or a Java decompiler like Procyon to analyze the bytecode and extract the class names.\n4. Filter out the abstract classes.\n5. Check if the class is a part of the xstream-1.4.20 project.\n\nThis approach assumes that you have the necessary permissions to clone or download the project and that you have the necessary tools to analyze the bytecode. If you don't have the necessary permissions or tools, you may need to contact the project maintainers or use a different approach.\n\nPlease note that the specific steps may vary depending on the project structure and the tools used to build and analyze the project.",
