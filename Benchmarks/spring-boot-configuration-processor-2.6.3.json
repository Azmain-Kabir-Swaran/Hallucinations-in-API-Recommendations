Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project or any other external resources. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Spring Boot project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the compiled classes of the project.\n2. Filter out abstract classes.\n3. Filter out classes that are not part of the Spring framework.\n4. Filter out classes that are not part of the Spring Boot framework.\n\nHere's a general approach in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.lang.reflect.Modifier;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Enumeration;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class ClassFinder {\n\n    public static List<String> getAllNonAbstractClasses(String packageName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n        List<String> classes = new ArrayList<>();\n        String path = packageName.replace('.', '/');\n        Enumeration<URL> dirs = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResources(path);\n        while (dirs.hasMoreElements()) {\n            URL url = dirs.nextElement();\n            File file = new File(url.getFile());\n            for (File f : file.listFiles()) {\n                if (f.isDirectory()) {\n                    classes.addAll(getAllNonAbstractClasses(packageName + \".\" + f.getName()));\n                } else if (f.getName().endsWith(\".class\")) {\n                    String className = packageName + \".\" + f.getName().substring(0, f.getName().length() - 6);\n                    Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className);\n                    if (!Modifier.isAbstract(clazz.getModifiers())) {\n                        classes.add(className);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return classes;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will give you a list of all non-abstract classes in a given package. You would need to modify it to fit your specific needs, such as filtering out classes that are not part of the Spring or Spring Boot framework.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and might not work for all cases. Also, it's important to handle exceptions properly in a production environment.",
