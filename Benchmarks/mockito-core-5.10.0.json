Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project or any other external resources. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the class is abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the problem, it's not feasible to provide the exact list of classes in this format.\n\nIf you have access to the source code, you can use a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to navigate through the code and find the classes.\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code, you might need to use a static analysis tool like SonarQube or PMD to find potential issues in the code.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, it's because you haven't provided the necessary context or information.",
