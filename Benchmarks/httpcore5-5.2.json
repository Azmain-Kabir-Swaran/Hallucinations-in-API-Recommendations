Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Parse the source code to identify classes.\n3. Check if the class is abstract.\n4. If the class is not abstract, add it to the list.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the problem, I can't provide a specific list of class names. You would need to do this manually or use a tool that can parse Java source code.\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you could use a tool like JavaParser, which can parse Java source code and extract class names. You would then need to write a script or program to check if the class is abstract and add it to a list if it's not.\n\nIf you don't know how to do this, I would recommend seeking help from a developer who is familiar with Java and source code analysis.",
