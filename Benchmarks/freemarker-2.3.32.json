Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to find the non-abstract classes in a Java project.\n\nHere are the steps to find the non-abstract classes in a Java project:\n\n1. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.\n2. Navigate to the package where the classes are located.\n3. Right-click on the package and select \"Find\" or \"Search\".\n4. In the search dialog, select \"Java\" from the dropdown.\n5. In the search text box, type \"abstract\" and press \"Find\".\n6. The IDE will show you all the abstract classes in the project.\n\nTo find the non-abstract classes, you can use the same steps but instead of searching for \"abstract\", search for \"class\".\n\nIf you want to find the classes in a specific project, you can use a text editor or IDE to search for the keyword \"class\" in the source code.\n\nPlease note that the number of classes in a project can vary greatly, and it's not feasible to list all the classes in a project.\n\nIf you want to find the classes in a specific project, you can use a text editor or IDE to search for the keyword \"class\" in the source code.",
