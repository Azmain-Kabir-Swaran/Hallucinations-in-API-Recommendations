Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project or any other external resources. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the code to identify classes that are not abstract.\n3. Filter out any abstract classes.\n4. List the names of the remaining classes.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned that you don't have the source code, I can't provide you with the exact class names. However, I can give you a general idea of how you might approach this problem.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Download the source code of the project. You can find it on the project's GitHub page.\n2. Unzip the downloaded file.\n3. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.\n4. Use the IDE's search functionality to find all non-abstract classes. You can do this by searching for \"public class\" followed by the class name.\n5. Copy the class names and paste them into a list.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the actual steps may vary depending on the specific project and the IDE you are using.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, it's because the source code is not available.",
