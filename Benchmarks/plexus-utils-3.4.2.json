Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI, I don't have direct access to the source code of a project to extract the class names. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how you can find the class names from a project.\n\nIn Java, you can use a tool like JD-GUI to decompile the jar file and then navigate through the source code to find the class names.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a tool like JDepend to analyze the dependencies of your project and generate a report that includes the names of the classes.\n\nIf you have access to the source code, you can navigate to the source code and look for the class declarations. They will typically look something like this:\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    // class body\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you can also use its built-in features to find all non-abstract classes in a project.\n\nIf you're not sure about the answer, it's best to ask someone who has access to the source code.",
