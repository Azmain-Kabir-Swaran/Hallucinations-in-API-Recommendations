Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's source code. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Kotlin project, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n2. Analyze the source code to find the classes and their properties.\n3. Filter out the abstract classes and interfaces.\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nHowever, as I don't have the ability to view the source code of a project, I can't provide you with the exact class names. However, I can give you a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Access the source code of the project.\n\nYou can download the source code from the project's GitHub repository.\n\n2. Analyze the source code to find the classes and their properties.\n\nYou can use a tool like IntelliJ IDEA to open the source code and navigate through the classes and their properties.\n\n3. Filter out the abstract classes and interfaces.\n\nYou can use the `abstract` keyword in Kotlin to define abstract classes and interfaces. You can filter out these classes and interfaces.\n\n4. List the non-abstract classes.\n\nYou can then list the remaining classes that are not abstract.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the actual steps may vary depending on the specific project and the structure of the code.",
