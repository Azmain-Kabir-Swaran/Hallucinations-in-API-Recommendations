Not more than 50 and classes are must be non-abstract. If you do not know the answer then reply with a No.\n\n@@ Response\nAs an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly access or view a project's code or dependencies. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nTo list correct API's class names from a Maven project, you would typically need to use a tool that can analyze the project's dependencies and classes. Maven is a popular choice for managing Java projects, and it uses the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the code.\n\nHere are the general steps you would take:\n\n1. Download and install the Maven project.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the Maven project.\n3. Run the command `mvn dependency:tree` to list all dependencies and their transitive dependencies.\n4. Look for classes that are not abstract.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the specifics may vary depending on the project structure and the dependencies used.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific project, you would need to provide more information about the project, such as the project's codebase, dependencies, and the specific classes you are looking for.",
