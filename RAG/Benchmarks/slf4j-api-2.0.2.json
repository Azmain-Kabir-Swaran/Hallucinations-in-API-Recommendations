So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies. The name of the class that has the main method should be Main.\n\n@@ Response\nAs per your requirements, below is a Java code using LoggerFactory API from the 'slf4j-api-2.0.2' project:\n\n```Java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class Main {\n    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        logger.info(\"Starting the application\");\n\n        // Your application logic here...\n\n        logger.info(\"Finished the application\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis java class will log information messages (like 'Starting the application' and 'Finished the application') to the console. \n\nIt's important to note that for LoggerFactory to work properly, there are also certain dependencies on your classpath.\nFor example, in your `pom.xml` you might have something like this:\n\n```XML\n<dependencies>\n    <!-- other dependencies -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>\n        <version>1.7.25</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jcl-over-slf4j</artifactId>\n        <version>1.7.25</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>\n        <version>1.7.25</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\nIn case you are building a Maven project, replace `<version>` with the actual slf4j version you have in your `pom.xml`.\n\nIf you're not using Maven, these libraries would need to be included in your classpath. For Gradle, you would put the following in `build.gradle`:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.25'\n    compile 'org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j:1.7.25'\n    compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.25'\n}\n```\n\nIn any case, replace the version with the exact version you're using.",

So, if you need to use other APIs, then do not use APIs whose import statements require adding new dependencies.

Here is the code, and you will need to include the \"slf4j-api-2.0.2\" and \"slf4j-simple-2.0.2\" dependencies in your pom.xml file in order to compile successfully. \n\nHere is an example using simple SLF4J which is quite similar to LoggerFactory API:\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    final static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        logger.info(\"Hello World\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to add the necessary dependencies to your pom.xml file as follows:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.2</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\n        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.2</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependencies, save the changes and then compile your Java project.\n\nThe code creates a new logger for the Main class, which will be using the SLF4J's Simple Logger. The `logger.info` call will write a message to the logger, which in this case will be printed to the console (because we're using the SimpleLogger provided by SLF4J). If you run your project, it should print: \n\n```\nHello World\n```\n\nPlease note that if you need a different logger or logger configuration, you need to add the appropriate dependency for it.",

If you want to use SLF4J as a logging framework, it's not a good idea to write complete code without clear requirements, because this greatly depends on what exactly you need to achieve.\n\nAlso, the imports and packages are limited. It's quite hard to determine what exactly you need from other libraries in your requirements (without them, they cannot be used in this case) and without given clear requirements you cannot provide a simple Java code. If you're not clear on exactly what you want, please provide specific requirements next time.\n\nHowever, if you would like some basic usage of SLF4J and Java classes as a starting point, then here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    final static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        logger.info(\"This is info message.\");\n        logger.debug(\"This is debug message.\");\n        logger.error(\"This is error message.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code should run without issue as long as the SLF4J bindings are properly implemented (binding is done via dependencies in your classpath).\n\nIf you have other requirements, please elaborate more clearly.",

Since we are not specifying the project, I'll provide a code snippet that will work in any Java project where you have \"slf4j-api\" on your classpath.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);\n        logger.info(\"This is an info message\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis program creates a logger using `LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class)` and logs an information message using `logger.info(\"This is an info message\")`.\n\nNote that you'll also need to ensure that the appropriate logging backend is also on your classpath (like logback, log4j, etc). The above example assumes that logback is on the classpath.",

The same for Marker and MarkerFactory. \n\nThe code then creates a Logger and a Marker, and logs some messages, attaching the Marker to one of the messages.\n\nPlease note that the example above only demonstrates the use of the MarkerFactory.

We need to add this `slf4j-api-2.0.2.jar` into the classpath and it's dependencies (like slf4j-jdk14-1.7.32.jar).\n\nHere is the example of `logback-classic-1.2.3.jar` configuration to use SLF4J API:\n\n`logback.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n    <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\">\n        <layout class=\"ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout\">\n            <Pattern>\n                %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n\n            </Pattern>\n        </layout>\n    </appender>\n    <root level=\"INFO\">\n        <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" />\n    </root>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nBefore running the java program we need to configure `logback.xml` and make sure it's present in the classpath or inside the resources folder.\n\nRemember that Java doesn't have a built-in logging utility. The `java.util.logging` package provided by Java is deprecated, and you would be better off with projects like SLF4J and LogBack or java.util.logging package provided by Java itself. These tools have features beyond what the standard utility provides (like logging to multiple locations, logging to files, etc.).",
